Best Practices for Writing High-Quality Code
============================================

1.  Select all the correct statements:
    1.  Idioms can be used to communicate the code intent.
    2.  Idioms can be used to explain what the code does.
    3.  Idioms can be misused and obscure the topic of conversation.
    4.  Idioms should be avoided in order to express the idea clearly.

2.  Is it necessary to implement hasCode() every time equals() is
    implemented?

4.  Does the deep copy notion apply to a primitive value during cloning?
5.  Which is faster, StringBuffer or StringBuilder?
6.  What are the benefits of coding to an interface?
7.  What are the benefits of using composition versus the inheritance?
8.  What is the advantage of using libraries versus writing your own
    code?
9.  Who is the target audience of your code?
